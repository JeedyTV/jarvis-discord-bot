# Description

a discord token id this is a tuto to have it [discord](https://discord.com/login?redirect_to=%2Fdevelopers%2Fapplications).

a wit.ai app id can be found here [wit](https://wit.ai).

I let u invastigate to retrieve this data basicaly you just need to make an account then make an app and go to the setting for the credentials.
for discord you migh need to tell that your app is a bot. (lot of tuto on ytb anyways).

Once you have completed the data in the config/config.json (wit.ai and discord token) and server/conf.ini for the spotify datas you can do this.

#for windows you need to run the .bat by double clicking on it or by doin this in your cmd(command promts or powershell).

```batch
